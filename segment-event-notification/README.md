# Segment Track Notification

This app sends an SMS to your number when your Segment-enabled website generates a specific tracking event.

## Pre-requisites

### Segment

A [Segment](https://segment.com/) account and a Connection that generates `track` events are pre-requisites for using this integration. You can register for a Segment account [here](http://app.segment.com/signup).

### Environment variables

This project requires some environment variables to be set. To keep your tokens and secrets secure, make sure to not commit the `.env` file in git. When setting up the project with `twilio serverless:init ...` the Twilio CLI will create a `.gitignore` file that excludes `.env` from the version history.

In your `.env` file, set the following values:

| Variable            | Description                                  | Required |
| :------------------ | :------------------------------------------- | :------- |
| SEGMENT_EVENT       | The event name you want to be notified about | Yes      |
| TWILIO_PHONE_NUMBER | A Twilio phone number                        | Yes      |
| MY_PHONE_NUMBER     | The phone number to notify                   | Yes      |

### Function Parameters

`/track-sms` exposes a webhook that expects a `POST` method whose body should contain a JSON-formatted Segment `track` event.
